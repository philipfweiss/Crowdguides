        Welcome to the guide creator! Here are a few things to know before you start.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Guides are composed of <b>Sections</b> and <b>Tasks</b>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use <b> Sections </b> to to seperate out parts of your guide.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use <b> Tasks </b> to describe your individual steps.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Each <b>Task</b> is automatically given an <b>Advice</b> button <%= render 'shared/simple_guide_creator/introduction_form_button' %> to help your users navigate the task.
        </li>
        <li> Each section of the advice button, <b>Blockers</b>, <b>Warnings</b>, and <b> Tips </b>, allow users to add new advice, read the advice that others have given previously, or upvote and downvote advice
            based on quality.
            <ul>
                <li>
                   <b>Blockers</b> are problems that could potentially prevent a user from continuing with the task.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Warnings</b> are less urgent problems, but could still potentially cause issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Tips</b> don't describe problems that could prevent a user from finishing a task, but instead
                    provide helpful advice that could make the users experience during this step.
                </li>


            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The <b>Preview</b> window on the right shows what your guide will look as you create it. Hit the "publish" button
            at the bottom to publish your guide. If you are a logged in user you will automatically become the owner of your guide
            and you can edit/curate it at any time in the future.
        </li>

    </ul>
